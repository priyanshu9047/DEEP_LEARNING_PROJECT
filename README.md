# DEEP LEARNING PROJECT  
This project implements an abstractive text summarization system using deep learning. It is based on a Seq2Seq LSTM encoder–decoder architecture with Bahdanau and Luong attention mechanisms to generate concise summaries from long news articles. The model is trained and evaluated using ROUGE metrics, and the performance of both attention techniques is compared.
